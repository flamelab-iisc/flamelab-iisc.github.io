This is mainly attributed to data communication and synchronization between different processing elements (PEs). This paper presents an asynchronous DG method that relaxes communication/synchronization at a mathematical level and allows computations at PEs to proceed regardless of the communication status, thus increasing the computation-communication overlap. We show that standard DG schemes under relaxed synchronization result in a loss of conservation property and provide solutions that are at most first-order accurate. Subsequently, we describe a simple method to preserve conservation and develop new asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that provide high-order accurate solutions. Results from simulations of one-dimensional linear and nonlinear equations are presented to verify the accuracy of the asynchronous DG method. },
