abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed to investigate the process
  of spontaneous ignition of hydrogen flames at laminar, turbulent, adiabatic and
  non-adiabatic conditions. Mixtures of hydrogen and vitiated air at temperatures
  representing gas-turbine reheat combustion are considered. Adiabatic spontaneous
  ignition processes are investigated first, providing a quantitative characterization
  of stable and unstable flames. Results indicate that, in hydrogen reheat combustion,
  compressibility effects play a key role in flame stability and that unstable ignition
  and combustion are consistently encountered for reactant temperatures close to the
  mixtureâ€™s characteristic crossover temperature. Furthermore, it is also found that
  the characterization of the adiabatic processes is also valid in the presence of
  non-adiabaticity due to wall heat-loss. Finally, a quantitative characterization
  of the instantaneous fuel consumption rate within the reaction front is obtained
  and of its ability, at auto-ignitive conditions, to advance against the approaching
  turbulent flow of the reactants, for a range of different turbulence intensities,
  temperatures and pressure levels.
