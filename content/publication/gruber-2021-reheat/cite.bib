 abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed to investigate the process of spontaneous ignition of hydrogen flames at laminar, turbulent, adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions. Mixtures of hydrogen and vitiated air at temperatures representing gas-turbine reheat combustion are considered. Adiabatic spontaneous ignition processes are investigated first, providing a quantitative characterization of stable and unstable flames. Results indicate that, in hydrogen reheat combustion, compressibility effects play a key role in flame stability and that unstable ignition and combustion are consistently encountered for reactant temperatures close to the mixtureâ€™s characteristic crossover temperature. Furthermore, it is also found that the characterization of the adiabatic processes is also valid in the presence of non-adiabaticity due to wall heat-loss. Finally, a quantitative characterization of the instantaneous fuel consumption rate within the reaction front is obtained and of its ability, at auto-ignitive conditions, to advance against the approaching turbulent flow of the reactants, for a range of different turbulence intensities, temperatures and pressure levels.},
