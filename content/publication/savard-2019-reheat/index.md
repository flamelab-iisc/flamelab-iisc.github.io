abstract: We address the problem of turbulent spontaneous ignition vs. deflagration
  propagating against a mean residence time gradient, particularly relevant to the
  stabilization of quasi-steady diesel flames and gas-turbine reheat combustion, by
  performing a large series of statistically one-dimensional premixed turbulent flame
  DNS. An autoignitve mixture of hydrogen-vitiated air representative of gas-turbine
  reheat combustion is considered. First, we demonstrate that turbulence can trigger
  the transition from spontaneous ignition to a deflagration. We then construct a
  spontaneous ignition vs. deflagration regime diagram based on inflow velocity, turbulent
  velocity fluctuations and integral length scale and identify the mechanism that
  governs the transition from one propagation mode to the other. Finally, we propose
  a theoretical model that captures accurately this transition and assess the validity
  of a proxy based on chemical explosive mode analysis to determine the local propagation
  mode in complex configurations.
