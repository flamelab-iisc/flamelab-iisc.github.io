abstract: ' View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2023-3461.vidIn practical
  combustors, flame stabilization is often achieved through the formation of recirculation
  zones as a result of their geometry. Cavity flameholders are used for flame stabilization
  in gas turbines and ram/scramjets. This study uses direct numerical simulation (DNS)
  to investigate flame stabilization and turbulent flame structure of premixed flames
  in a backward-facing step configuration. A lean mixture of ethylene and air, relevant
  to scramjet combustion, is introduced at the inlet of the combustor and evolved
  until a statistically stationary state is reached. Instantaneous and averaged fields
  of relevant quantities show a flame stabilized at the tip of the step, which is
  supported by a recirculation zone transporting vital radicals and enthalpy. Analysis
  of averages of reaction rates conditioned on progress variable shows a shift in
  the chemical pathway induced by the transported species from the recirculation zones,
  aiding flame stabilization. Additionally, it is observed that the shear layer generated
  eddies impact the preheat zone near the edge of the cavity, while their impact shifts
  toward higher progress variable values in the flame brush further downstream. '
