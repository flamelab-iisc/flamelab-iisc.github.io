Cavity flameholders are used for flame stabilization in gas turbines and ram/scramjets. This study uses direct numerical simulation (DNS) to investigate flame stabilization and turbulent flame structure of premixed flames in a backward-facing step configuration. A lean mixture of ethylene and air, relevant to scramjet combustion, is introduced at the inlet of the combustor and evolved until a statistically stationary state is reached. Instantaneous and averaged fields of relevant quantities show a flame stabilized at the tip of the step, which is supported by a recirculation zone transporting vital radicals and enthalpy. Analysis of averages of reaction rates conditioned on progress variable shows a shift in the chemical pathway induced by the transported species from the recirculation zones, aiding flame stabilization. Additionally, it is observed that the shear layer generated eddies impact the preheat zone near the edge of the cavity, while their impact shifts toward higher progress variable values in the flame brush further downstream. },
