abstract: ' View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-3448.vidThe second
  combustion stage in a longitudinally-staged combustion system (reheat combustion
  in a sequential combustor) plays an important role in ensuring stable and flexible
  operation while achieving desired combustion characteristics ultimately resulting
  in an efficient, low-emissions and fuel-flexible gas turbine engine. Of particular
  interest is the combustion of pure hydrogen in such a reheat combustion system,
  which potentially represents the best way to reduce carbon emissions in the power
  generation sector. The highly reactive and diffusive properties of hydrogen result
  in significant challenges in controlling the combustion process and require a fundamental
  understanding of its rate-controlling features via a detailed investigation. Recently,
  three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a premixed hydrogen flame
  at reheat combustion conditions, but limited to atmospheric pressure, revealed specific
  features of the different combustion modes that characterize different spatial locations
  within the combustion chamber. The present work investigates the pressure scaling
  characteristics of reheat flames using two-dimensional DNS. Three different pressure
  levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) are investigated, capturing key changes in chemical pathways
  in hydrogen-air combustion. The flame stabilization characteristics and its structure
  compared to a homologous laminar flame are discussed. Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis
  (CEMA) is employed as a diagnostic tool to quantify the fuel consumption between
  the autoignition and flame propagation modes. With increase in pressure, a significant
  decrease in fuel consumption due to the predominance of the autoignition mode is
  observed. '
