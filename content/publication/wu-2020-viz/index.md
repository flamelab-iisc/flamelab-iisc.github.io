abstract: The use of adaptive workflow management for in situ visualization and analysis
  has been a growing trend in large-scale scientific simulations. However, coordinating
  adaptive workflows with traditional procedural programming languages can be difficult
  because system flow is determined by unpredictable scientific phenomena, which often
  appear in an unknown order and can evade event handling. This makes the implementation
  of adaptive workflows tedious and error-prone. Recently, reactive and declarative
  programming paradigms have been recognized as well-suited solutions to similar problems
  in other domains. However, there is a dearth of research on adapting these approaches
  to in situ visualization and analysis. With this paper, we present a language design
  and runtime system for developing adaptive systems through a declarative and reactive
  programming paradigm. We illustrate how an adaptive workflow programming system
  is implemented using our approach and demonstrate it with a use case from a combustion
  simulation.
