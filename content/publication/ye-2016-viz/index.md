abstract: The growing power and capacity of supercomputers enable scientific simulations
  at extreme scale, leading to not only more accurate modeling and greater predictive
  ability but also massive quantities of data to analyze. New approaches to data analysis
  and visualization are this needed to support interactive exploration through selective
  data access for gaining insights into terabytes and petabytes of data. In this paper,
  we present an in situ data processing method for both generating probability distribution
  functions (PDFs) from field data and reorganizing particle data using a single spatial
  organization scheme. This coupling between PDFs and particles allows for the interactive
  post hoc exploration of both data types simultaneously. Scientists can explore trends
  in large-scale data through the PDFs and subsequently extract desired particle subsets
  for further analysis. We evaluate the usability of our in situ method using a petascale
  combustion simulation and demonstrate the increases in task efficiency and accuracy
  that the resulting workflow provides to scientists.
