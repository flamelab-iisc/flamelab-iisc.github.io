 abstract = {The growing power and capacity of supercomputers enable scientific simulations at extreme scale, leading to not only more accurate modeling and greater predictive ability but also massive quantities of data to analyze. New approaches to data analysis and visualization are this needed to support interactive exploration through selective data access for gaining insights into terabytes and petabytes of data. In this paper, we present an in situ data processing method for both generating probability distribution functions (PDFs) from field data and reorganizing particle data using a single spatial organization scheme. This coupling between PDFs and particles allows for the interactive post hoc exploration of both data types simultaneously. Scientists can explore trends in large-scale data through the PDFs and subsequently extract desired particle subsets for further analysis. We evaluate the usability of our in situ method using a petascale combustion simulation and demonstrate the increases in task efficiency and accuracy that the resulting workflow provides to scientists.},
