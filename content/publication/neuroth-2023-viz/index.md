abstract: Spatial statistical analysis of multivariate volumetric data can be challenging
  due to scale, complexity, and occlusion. Advances in topological segmentation, feature
  extraction, and statistical summarization have helped overcome the challenges. This
  work introduces a new spatial statistical decomposition method based on level sets,
  connected components, and a novel variation of the restricted centroidal Voronoi
  tessellation that is better suited for spatial statistical decomposition and parallel
  efficiency. The resulting data structures organize features into a coherent nested
  hierarchy to support flexible and efficient out-of-core region-of-interest extraction.
  Next, we provide an efficient parallel implementation. Finally, an interactive visualization
  system based on this approach is designed and then applied to turbulent combustion
  data. The combined approach enables an interactive spatial statistical analysis
  workflow for large-scale data with a top-down approach through multiple-levels-of-detail
  that links phase space statistics with spatial features.
