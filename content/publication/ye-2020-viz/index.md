abstract: The development of usable visualization solutions is essential for ensuring
  both their adoption and effectiveness. User-centered design principles, which involve
  users throughout the entire development process, have been shown to be effective
  in numerous information visualization endeavors. We describe how we applied these
  principles in scientific visualization over a two year collaboration to develop
  a hybrid in situ/post hoc solution tailored towards combustion researcher needs.
  Furthermore, we examine the importance of user-centered design and lessons learned
  over the design process in an effort to aid others seeking to develop effective
  scientific visualization solutions.
