 abstract = {In this study, we outline the design and implementation of a portable massively parallel asynchronous solver for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). The solver is implemented using Kokkos library for portability across different node architectures and is coupled with the communication-avoiding algorithm that relaxes the communication across nodes, thus improving the scalability. Asynchrony-tolerant finite difference schemes for spatial derivatives along with the low storage Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration are used to achieve high-order accuracy. The efficacy of the implementation is demonstrated using a mini-app that solves the three-dimensional diffusion problem.},
