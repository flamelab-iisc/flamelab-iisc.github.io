abstract: ' We analyse laminar thermal plumes and their interactions originating from
  line sources using two-dimensional simulations for a range of Rayleigh numbers ($$hbox
  Ra_f$$, which is based on the constant heat flux supplied at the source), spanning
  from $$10^4$$to $$10^8$$. Initially, a single-plume system is examined by systematically
  varying $$hbox Ra_f$$within the range of $$10^4$$to $$10^8$$. Subsequently, we explore
  a two-plume system, wherein the separation between the sources is within a range
  of four to twelve times the radius (R) of the cylindrical heater. Additionally,
  we have explored an equivalent single-plume scenario with an effective $$hbox Ra_f$$of
  $$10^6$$. The analysis establishes an empirical correlation for the cap-tip velocity
  ($$v_textrmc$$) and the steady-state average temperature of the heater with $$hbox
  Ra_f$$. Notably, we observe that the sensitivity of these parameters to variations
  in $$hbox Ra_f$$is comparatively lower when compared to that in the case of point
  source heaters. Furthermore, the merged plume, which manifests in the case of the
  two-plume system, exhibited heightened stability for larger source separations.
  This increased stability is due to the diminished generation of vorticity and velocity
  fluctuations along the plume stem. Interestingly, we observe that the cap-tip velocity
  of the merged plume remained unaffected by the source separations. Following the
  merging of plumes, the two-plume system displays lateral mass ejections that increase
  with the source separations. These lateral mass ejections facilitate augmented heat
  transfer in the lateral direction, though at the expense of compromised heat transfer
  in the downstream direction.'
