abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) with detailed chemical kinetics and chemical
  explosive mode analysis (CEMA) are performed to investigate the effect of operating
  pressure and hydrogen–methane blending on laminar wrinkled flames at reheat combustion
  conditions. Building upon previous three-dimensional DNS datasets of reheat hydrogen
  flames, the present work considers two-dimensional configurations that render computationally-feasible
  simulations of high-pressure combustion and significantly more complex hydrocarbon
  chemistry. A geometrically-simplified representation of the reheat combustor is
  adopted and the thermodynamic states considered in the simulations are carefully
  chosen to mimic gas turbine operation conditions, which are constrained to achieve
  a target flame position and flame temperature. The two-dimensional DNS results are
  first assessed against the available three-dimensional data and then analyzed to
  extract the main trends exhibited by the reheat combustion process with respect
  to the fraction of the fuel consumed by spontaneous ignition and flame propagation,
  for increasing pressures and hydrogen fractions. Due to significant differences
  in the characteristic features of the velocity and thermal boundary layers between
  the three-dimensional and the two-dimensional configurations, a different global
  flame shape is observed (V-shaped flame vs W-shape flame) together with a ∼10% bias
  in the fraction of fuel consumed by spontaneous ignition. Crucially, results from
  the scaling studies reveal very clear trends with a significant decrease in the
  fuel consumption by spontaneous ignition for increasing pressures and hydrogen fractions,
  at the conditions investigated. Finally, this study highlights the important role
  that first-principle direct numerical simulations, even when conducted in computationally
  affordable two-dimensional simplified geometrical configurations, can play in obtaining
  detailed insights and quantitative trends useful for the characterization of complex
  reactive flows. Novelty and significance The reheat burners of the two-stage sequential
  gas turbine combustors are designed to stabilize flames primarily due to spontaneous
  ignition. However, prior numerical simulations revealed the presence of an additional
  assisted-ignition mode aided by recirculation zones. In this study, we used practically
  feasible two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of premixed hydrogen–air mixtures
  under lean conditions to quantify the roles of the two flame stabilization modes
  at different operating pressures. Achieving fundamental understanding of the effect
  of pressure and hydrogen fraction on flame stabilization is crucial to the development
  of two-stage sequential combustion and the present two-dimensional calculations
  provide important new insights. We show that at high pressures, both modes consume
  fuel to a similar extent. We also investigated the effect of methane blending on
  flame stabilization. This study also discusses how two-dimensional direct numerical
  simulations can be leveraged in the design optimization of reheat burners at low
  technology readiness levels.
