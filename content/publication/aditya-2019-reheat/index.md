abstract: A three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed for a
  turbulent hydrogen-air flame, represented with detailed chemistry, stabilized in
  a model gas-turbine combustor. The combustor geometry consists of a mixing duct
  followed by a sudden expansion and a combustion chamber, which represents a geometrically
  simplified version of Ansaldo Energiaâ€™s GT26/GT36 sequential combustor design. In
  this configuration, a very lean blend of hydrogen and vitiated air is prepared in
  the mixing duct and convected into the combustion chamber, where the residence time
  from the inlet of the mixing duct to the combustion chamber is designed to coincide
  with the ignition delay time of the mixture. The results show that when the flame
  is stabilized at its design position, combustion occurs due to both autoignition
  and flame propagation (deflagration) modes at different locations within the combustion
  chamber. A chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) reveals that most of the fuel
  is consumed due to autoignition in the bulk-flow along the centerline of the combustor,
  and lower amounts of fuel are consumed by flame propagation near the corners of
  the sudden expansion, where the unburnt temperature is reduced by the thermal wall
  boundary layers. An unstable operating condition is also identified, wherein periodic
  auto-ignition events occur within the mixing duct. These events appear upstream
  of the intended stabilization position, due to positive temperature fluctuations
  induced by pressure waves originating from within the combustion chamber. The present
  DNS investigation represents the initial step of a comprehensive research effort
  aimed at gaining detailed physical insight into the rate-limiting processes that
  govern the sequential combustor behavior and avoid the insurgence of the off-design
  auto-ignition events.
