abstract: High-order asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes are used to solve the compressible
  Navier-Stokes equations. The AT schemes are validated for accuracy using canonical
  flow problems and are found to be in excellent agreement with the standard schemes.
  Strong and weak scaling analyses are performed, and significant speedups (up to
  3.5x) are observed for the asynchronous algorithms compared to the standard synchronous
  algorithm.
