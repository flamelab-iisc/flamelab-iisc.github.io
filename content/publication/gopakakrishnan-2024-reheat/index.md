abstract: Hydrogen and ammonia are considered crucial carbon-free energy carriers
  optimally suited for seasonal chemical storage and balancing of the energy system.
  In this context, longitudinally staged combustion systems represent an attractive
  technology in power generation for their capability of achieving low NOx emissions
  while conserving high load and, crucially, fuel flexibility at high thermal efficiency.
  Such two-stage combustion systems have been successfully implemented for natural
  gas firing of gas turbines and, more recently, have shown significant potential
  for clean and efficient hydrogen-firing operation. However, optimal operation with
  ammonia-based fuel mixtures is yet to be established. In recent works, a novel Rich-Quench-Lean
  (RQL) operational concept was proposed to burn a fuel-rich mixture of partially
  decomposed ammonia and air (for equivalence ratios ϕ∼1.1−1.2) in the first stage
  of a longitudinally staged combustion system. Complete oxidation of the remaining
  (hydrogen) fuel is theoretically ensured by dilution-air addition downstream of
  the first stage combustor. However, any operational concept based on these near-stoichiometric
  combustion conditions, while minimizing undesired prompt NOx and N2O formation by
  ammonia oxidation, can potentially result in significant, and certainly unpractical,
  thermal load on the first stage combustor liner that needs to be mitigated. In the
  present study, we exploit a newly developed reactors-network model to efficiently
  investigate the NOx-emissions performance of a longitudinally staged combustion
  system fired with natural gas, hydrogen or ammonia. First, the reactors network
  framework is validated with experimental, computational and other similar reactor
  network results in the literature. Second, the optimal air distribution within the
  longitudinally staged combustion system is found for clean (low emissions) and efficient
  (complete fuel conversion) ammonia-firing operation. Third, the consequences of
  such “ammonia-optimized” air distribution on flame stabilization and NOx emissions
  in more conventional natural gas- and hydrogen-firing operation are considered.
  Finally, an optimal air and fuel distribution is suggested for the longitudinally
  staged combustion system on the basis that, while still ensuring robust flame stabilization
  and high turbine inlet temperature, it minimizes NOx emissions for all three fuels
  considered.
