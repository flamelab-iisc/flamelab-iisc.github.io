 abstract = {For turbulent reacting flow systems, identification of low-dimensional representations of the thermo-chemical state space is vitally important, primarily to significantly reduce the computational cost of device-scale simulations. Principal component analysis (PCA), and its variants, are a widely employed class of methods. Recently, an alternative technique that focuses on higher-order statistical interactions, co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA), has been shown to effectively provide a low-dimensional representation by capturing the stiff chemical dynamics associated with spatiotemporally localized reaction zones. While its effectiveness has only been demonstrated based on a priori analyses with linear reconstruction, in this work, we employ nonlinear techniques to reconstruct the full thermo-chemical state and evaluate the efficacy of CoK-PCA compared to PCA. Specifically, we combine a CoK-PCA-/PCA-based dimensionality reduction (encoding) with an artificial neural network (ANN) based reconstruction (decoding) and examine, a priori, the reconstruction errors of the thermo-chemical state. In addition, we evaluate the errors in species production rates and heat release rates, which are nonlinear functions of the reconstructed state, as a measure of the overall accuracy of the dimensionality reduction technique. We employ four datasets to assess CoK-PCA/PCA coupled with ANN-based reconstruction: zero-dimensional (homogeneous) reactor for autoignition of an ethylene/air mixture that has conventional single-stage ignition kinetics, a dimethyl ether (DME)/air mixture which has two-stage (low and high temperature) ignition kinetics, a one-dimensional freely propagating premixed ethylene/air laminar flame, and a two-dimensional dataset representing turbulent autoignition of ethanol in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. Results from the analyses demonstrate the robustness of the CoK-PCA based low-dimensional manifold with ANN reconstruction in accurately capturing the data, specifically from the reaction zones.},
