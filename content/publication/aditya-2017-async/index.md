abstract: Synchronizations of processing elements (PEs) in massively parallel simulations,
  which arise due to communication or load imbalances between PEs, significantly affect
  the scalability of scientific applications. We have recently proposed a method based
  on finite-difference schemes to solve partial differential equations in an asynchronous
  fashion â€“ synchronization between PEs is relaxed at a mathematical level. While
  standard schemes can maintain their stability in the presence of asynchrony, their
  accuracy is drastically affected. In this work, we present a general methodology
  to derive asynchrony-tolerant (AT) finite difference schemes of arbitrary order
  of accuracy, which can maintain their accuracy when synchronizations are relaxed.
  We show that there are several choices available in selecting a stencil to derive
  these schemes and discuss their effect on numerical and computational performance.
  We provide a simple classification of schemes based on the stencil and derive schemes
  that are representative of different classes. Their numerical error is rigorously
  analyzed within a statistical framework to obtain the overall accuracy of the solution.
  Results from numerical experiments are used to validate the performance of the schemes.
