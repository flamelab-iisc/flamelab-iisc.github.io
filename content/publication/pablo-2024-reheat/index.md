abstract: This paper presents an investigation of the effects of water injection within
  a simplified version of the Ansaldo GT36 reheat system. The investigation is carried
  out under realistic operating conditions of 20 atm and using large eddy simulation
  (LES) coupled with the thickened flame model (TFM) and an adaptive mesh refinement.
  The water injection conditions are optimized by performing a parametric study based
  on global sensitivity analysis and a surrogate model based on Gaussian process is
  employed as a way to reduce computational cost. In particular, the influence on
  the system performance of four design parameters, namely Sauter mean diameter, water
  mass flow and the angles of the spray’s hollow cone, is tested to achieve an optimized
  solution. In the ‘dry’ case, the LES simulations show several flashback events,
  which are a defining aspect of the considered conditions, and attributed to compressive
  pressure waves resulting from autoignition in the core flow near the crossover temperature.
  The use of water injection is found to be effective in suppressing the flashback
  occurrence. In particular, the global sensitivity analysis shows that the external
  angle of the spray cone and the mass flow of water are the most important design
  parameters for flashback prevention. Moreover, NOx was shown to be reduced by about
  17% by the use of the water injection at the tested conditions. Once an optimised
  condition with water injection is found, a recently proposed method to downscale
  the combustor to lower pressures is applied and tested. Additional LES are performed
  for this purpose at the ‘dry’, unstable condition and the ‘wet’, stable condition.
  Results show that similar dynamics, respectively unstable and stable, is predicted
  at 1 atm, suggesting the robustness of the method. This provides avenues for experimentally
  testing combustion dynamics at simplified conditions which are still representative
  of high-pressure practical configurations.
