Hi everyone, I am a National Postdoctoral Fellow (NPDF) working in the FLAME Lab. I completed my Ph.D. at IIT Madras, where I focused on modeling catalytic micro-combustors integrated with thermoelectric devices for energy-to-power conversion. During my postdoctoral work, I aim to deepen my expertise in combustion, strengthen my modeling skills, and explore applications of machine learning in combustion. I believe this combination will equip me for a future academic position or a strong career in industry.
