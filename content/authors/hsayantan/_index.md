I worked in developing a Discontinuous Galerkin based scalable solver for the Navier Stokes Equations. My interest lies in discontinuous numerical techniques, High Performance Computing and Reinforcement Learning.
          
Outside of academics I have a passion for photography and trekking.

**Current Position:** Data Scientist at ZS Associates
