Hi! I am Dhruthi, an inquisitive second-year M.Tech student working on multiscale modeling. I am keen on exploring new ideas, with molecular dynamics being my current interest. I have a deep passion for science and I truly believe in its potential to benefit society. 

Beyond academics, I enjoy classical dance, poetry, and playing chess. I am a huge Potterhead who is immensely fascinated by beaches and ice creams.
