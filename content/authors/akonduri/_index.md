I work as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, United States. 

My current research includes large scale simulations of turbulent combustion relevant to gas turbine and scramjet engines, design of machine learning methods for anomalous/extreme event detection in scientific phenomena, and development of scalable asynchronous numerical methods and simulation algorithms for solving partial differential equations on massively parallel computing systems.
