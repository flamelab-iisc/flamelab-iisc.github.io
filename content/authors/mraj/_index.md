I am a person who likes to live a simple life but in a fascinating way. I try to be friendly and generous to everyone I meet. I have an outgoing personality and enjoy hanging out with people that aren't self-centred. I kind of love adventures like trekking in Himalayas or long bike ride to hill stations or marathon running etc., thanks to adventure club in IITK.
