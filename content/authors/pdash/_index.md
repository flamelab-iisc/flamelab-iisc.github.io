Hi! I am a PhD student in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences at IISc Bangalore. I am a member of the FLAME lab, supervised by Dr. Konduri Aditya. My work primarily involves numerical simulations of turbulent reacting flows using high-performance computing architecture and the relevant data analysis. Prior to IISc, I had a brief stint as a Management Trainee in Tata Steel.

I have received my undergraduate degree from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. My bachelors' thesis was based on the modeling and simulation of dissimilar friction stir welding. Apart from research, I spend my time playing badminton or watching sports/sitcoms/anime.
