I am enrolled in the Ph.D. program at CDS, IISc, and associated with FLAME Lab headed by Dr. Konduri Aditya since 2019. Currently, I am working on asynchronous numerical schemes for partial differential equations. My research work includes the performance analysis of numerical methods such as finite difference and discontinuous-Galerkin and studying the effects of introducing asynchrony to them while performing parallel computations on massively parallel supercomputers. The aim is to develop a highly scalable DG-based PDE solver.

Apart from research, my other interests include traveling, trekking, and nature photography. I am incredibly fond of nature and its beauty and love to explore new places.
