I am an M. Tech student at the department of Computational and Data Sciences, IISc and associated with FLAME Lab headed by Dr. Konduri Aditya. I am currently working on an asynchronous DG method for flow simulations. The goal of my research is to create a highly scalable DG solver.   

Apart from this, my interests include reading books and photography. I like to play Cricket.
