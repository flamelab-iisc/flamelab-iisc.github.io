<!-- Highly motivated individual, eager to work in the intersection of chemical engineering and computational sciences.  -->

I am an undergraduate student, persuing B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangalore Institute of Technology(BIT) Benagluru. 
I am working as an Intern at FlAME lab at CDS, IISc.

My work focuses on Parallel Programming Concepts using Regent for developing Asynchronous schemes for Partial Differential Equations and Machine-Learning concepts for detecting the anomalies.
My interest also lies on Cloud Computing. 

Apart from research, my other interests are playing cricket, nature photography and traveling. 
**Current Position:** Ph.D. student at UC Riverside
