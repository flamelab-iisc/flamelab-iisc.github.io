The SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering is a biennial conference facilitating in-depth technical discussions on a wide variety of major computational efforts on large-scale problems in science and engineering, foster the interdisciplinary culture required to meet these large-scale challenges, and promote the training of the next generation of computational scientists. Shubham's work on "Stability analysis of the asynchronous discontinuous-Galerkin method" was selected for the oral presentation. To attend this conference, he received two travel grants, namely the SIAM Student Travel Award and the ODAA IISc Student Travel Grant.
