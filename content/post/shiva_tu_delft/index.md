Our collaborative work with TU Delft, Netherlands on "Data-driven identification of precursors of flashback in a lean hydrogen reheat combustor" was published in the Proceedings of the Combustion Institute.

We propose a data-driven framework to identify precursors of extreme events in turbulent reacting flows. Our framework is composed of two parts. The first consists of the use of a co-kurtosis based approach to identify the components of the thermochemical and flow state which are the most relevant for the onset of flashback. A modularity-based clustering algorithm is then employed to segregate clusters that contain normal and extreme flashbacking states and the clusters located in between these states, which are the precursor states of extreme events. Our work proposes for the first time a data-driven technique to automatically identify precursors of flashback in hydrogen combustion opening the path for such applications on other extreme events in reacting flows.
