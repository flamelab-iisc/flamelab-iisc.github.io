Congratulations to Shubham for winning the Best Poster Award at the CHTC conference (Topical Meeting on Computations of High-speed Turbulent and Complex Flows), which was held between June 28th and 29th, 2024, at IIT Hyderabad. Shubham, along with co-authors Vidyesh Dapse and Konduri Aditya, received the award for their work titled "A scalable asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel flow simulations."

The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at IIT Hyderabad is hosting an annual series of Topical Meetings on varied subjects. The first Topical Meeting was held on the theme of Computations of High-Speed, Turbulent, and Complex Flows, and it featured a two-day conference with research talks, pedagogical lectures, and poster presentations. Raj, Shiva, and Shubham from FLAME Lab were among the 30+ students who presented posters. The three posters from FLAME Lab were on the topics of:

- **Raj:** A novel multiscale modeling methodology for chemical kinetic modeling of fuel oxidation using atomic calculations.
- **Shiva:** An a-posteriori analysis of co-kurtosis PCA-based dimensionality reduction using Neural ODE.
- **Shubham:** A scalable asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel flow simulations.

Among all the poster presentations, five of them were selected for the best posters, and Shubham was one of the winners. We extend our congratulations to Shubham and all the other winners. The experience was very positive for the three lab students, who were able to showcase their work to the CFD community and receive helpful feedback.
