Combustion represents a complex interplay of multiple physics and scales, encompassing the simultaneous occurrence of chemistry and flow physics at varying length and time scales. Consequently, when simulating combustion at a continuum scale, the chemistry is typically provided as input while the flow physics is solved. However, the accuracy of this input is compromised by the inherent limitations of sensitivity analysis. To address this, a groundbreaking approach is presented in this study, wherein the chemistry is extracted from a single atomistic simulation, offering a more precise input for the continuum scale simulation. Our research represents a significant advancement in the field of combustion simulation, offering a novel methodology that bridges the gap between atomistic and continuum scales. Sharing these findings with an international audience will contribute to the collective understanding of combustion science and pave the way for future research directions.
