Many congratulations to Shubham for successfully defending his doctoral thesis titled "A scalable asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel flow simulations" on August 5th, 2024. He joined the FLAME Lab in August 2019 and was the first PhD student in the lab. His research was focused on the development of asynchronous numerical schemes and demonstrating their scalability at extreme scales.

Shubham, the first PhD student at the FLAME Lab, successfully defended his doctoral thesis titled "A scalable asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel flow simulations" on August 5th, 2024. The objective of his thesis was to introduce novel asynchronous numerical schemes that avoid communication and synchronization at a mathematical level, develop an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method based PDE solver, and demonstrate its scalability for extreme-scale computations. The thesis defense was attended by Professor Praveen Chandrasekhar from TIFR-CAM, along with other faculty members and students. The FLAME Lab extends its congratulations to Shubham on his accomplishment and conveys its best wishes for his future endeavours.
