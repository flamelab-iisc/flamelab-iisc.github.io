Our paper titled "A scale-similarity based workflow for the self-supervised reconstruction of small-scales in turbulence using deep learning," has been accepted for publication as a journal article in Physics of Fluids. Co-authored by Priyabrat and Dr. Aditya, this paper presents a physics-guided, self-supervised methodology incorporating the scale-similarity hypothesis to reconstruct small scales in turbulent flow simulations. This work has been selected as an editor's pick as well!
