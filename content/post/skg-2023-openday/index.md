Open Day is a yearly event of the IISc, during which the institute is open to the general public, who visit different departments and where students and faculty showcase their research work. In the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, a three-minute thesis competition was organized on Open Day 2024 (February 24, 2024), where PhD students nearing completion of their studies were required to present their work to a general audience within a three-minute timeframe. A significant number of PhD students from the department participated in this competition. Shubham was awarded the first-place prize for his presentation titled "A scalable asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers."
