The paper titled “An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers” co-authored by Shubham K. Goswami and Dr. Konduri Aditya has been published in Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering. This paper proposes an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method that avoids communication/synchronization at a mathematical level, investigates its numerical properties including conservation, stability, and accuracy, and develops new asynchrony-tolerant numerical fluxes. The theoretical findings are also validated with numerical results from linear/nonlinear problems.
