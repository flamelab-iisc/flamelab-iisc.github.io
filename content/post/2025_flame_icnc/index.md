The International Conference on Numerical Combustion (ICNC) is a biennial conference on numerical combustion sponsored by the Combustion Institute (CI). Dr. Aditya, Priyabrat, Aritra and Aswin provided oral presentations of contributed works from the lab, titled "A co-kurtosis based dimensionality reduction for chemical kinetics using neural ODEs", "A graph neural network-based framework for superresolution of turbulent reacting flows on complex meshes", "Combustion dynamics in trapped vortex combustor: effect of hydrogen blending" and "An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for combustion simulations", respectively.
