The Asia-Pacific Conference on Combustion (ASPACC) is a regional combustion conference sponsored by the Combustion Institute (CI). The ASPACC is held every two years, and its location rotates among different CI sections in the Asia-Pacific region. Dr. Aditya delivered a keynote lecture titled "Machine learning for combustion applications", while Shiva and Aswin provided oral presentations of contributed works from the lab, titled "An a-posteriori analysis of cokurtosis PCA based dimensionality reduction using a neural ODE solver" and "An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for combustion simulations", respectively. It was an enriching experience interacting with peers from academia and industry.
