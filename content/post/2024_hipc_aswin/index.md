The 31st IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC) is a yearly event that serves as a platform for researchers from all over the world to present their latest work and showcase activities in the high performance computing and data science fields in Asia. In addition to invited talks and oral presentations, the conference features a Student Research Symposium (SRS) where students display posters and hold lightning talks to present their research. The poster entitled "Asynchrony-tolerant schemes to enhance scalability of compressible-flow solver", co-authored by Aswin Kumar A, Nagabhushana Rao Vadlamani (IIT Madras) and Konduri Aditya, won the best poster award in the undergraduate category. Another poster from our lab, entitled "Building a portable asynchronous PDE solver using Kokkos", co-authored by Ranjan Bhat and Konduri Aditya also featured in the symposium.
